# Optimized images

This project is a React application built using Vite. It renders a grid of 10 images, displaying two images in a row. Before the main image fully loads, a small blurry version of the main image is shown as a placeholder. Additionally, a pulsing animation indicates that the main image is loading. Once the main image is loaded, the smaller blurry image is hidden, and the main image is smoothly animated into place.
